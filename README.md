# mattlibs

A simple MadLibs-style word game, written with Python3.

Basically, it takes a set of words from you (one at a time), and inputs them into a story.  

If you haen't played the real MadLibs(r), I highly recomment trying them out.  They're especially fun with a group of people.


This is still under construction.
